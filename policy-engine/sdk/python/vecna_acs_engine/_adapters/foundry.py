    """Govern a live Azure AI Foundry hosted agent run loop with ACS.

    Foundry's governance seam is the manual run loop, not a single client
    method. The host posts a message, creates a run, then polls until the run
    reports ``requires_action`` and hands back the tool calls the model wants to
    make. This adapter intercepts at that seam. Each required function tool call
    is routed through ``control.run_tool`` so ``pre_tool_call`` gates the
    arguments and ``post_tool_call`` gates the result before the output is
    submitted back to the model.

    The return value is a thin proxy over the real ``AgentsClient`` that adds a
    governed run driver (``create_thread_and_run`` and ``run_until_complete``)
    and blocks the SDK's auto-function-call paths. ``enable_auto_function_calls``,
    ``create_thread_and_process_run``, ``runs.create_and_process``, and the
    streaming run helpers execute or surface Python tool calls outside the gated
    loop, so they are blocked rather than delegated. ``threads``, ``messages``,
    and the remaining ``runs`` operations pass through unchanged.

    ``tools`` maps a Foundry function tool name to the host callable that
    implements it. The model picks the tool and supplies JSON object arguments.
    The callable is invoked with those arguments as keywords only after
    ``pre_tool_call`` allows or transforms them. In enforce mode a deny submits a
    policy rejection output instead of executing, so the underlying callable
    never runs. An escalate is routed to ``approval_resolver`` and is never
    auto-allowed. A suspend approval outcome raises ``AgentControlSuspended`` so
    the host owns resumption. In evaluate-only mode nothing is enforced, so the
    callable runs and its real output is submitted.
