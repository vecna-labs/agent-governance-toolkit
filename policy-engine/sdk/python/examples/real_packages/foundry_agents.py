"""Govern an Azure AI Foundry Agents tool call with ACS, end to end.

This is a *real* integration reference, not a mocked one. It uses the genuine
Azure AI Foundry Agents SDK (``azure-ai-agents``) to declare function tools, and
it makes a real Azure OpenAI call: the ACS policy is backed by an LLM judge that
classifies each tool argument before the tool is allowed to run. Nothing here is
stubbed with canned JSON, so it doubles as a live smoke test.

The governance contract lives in two committed artifacts next to this file, the
way a production integration ships them, rather than in Python:

* ``foundry_governance.acs.yaml`` is the ACS manifest. It declares the
  intervention points, the live Azure OpenAI ``intent_judge`` annotator, and the
  Rego policy that consumes the judge label.
* ``policy/foundry_tool_guard.rego`` is the deterministic decision. It fails
  closed, allowing a tool call only when the judge labels it ``safe``.

``build_control`` loads the manifest and resolves the Rego bundle. The Rego
policy runs through OPA, so ``opa`` must be on ``PATH`` (or ``ACS_OPA_PATH``).

Run it with real credentials set (see ``_common.require_azure``)::

    export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=...        # https://<resource>.openai.azure.com
    export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=...       # e.g. gpt-4o / gpt-5.x
    export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=...      # e.g. 2025-04-01-preview
    pip install "agent-control-specification" azure-ai-agents
    # opa must be on PATH for the Rego policy bundle
    python foundry_agents.py

It demonstrates two integration styles for the *same* governed seam:

* the short path -- ``control.protect_tool(...)`` returns a drop-in async
  wrapper that evaluates PRE_TOOL_CALL and POST_TOOL_CALL, applies any
  transform, and raises ``AgentControlBlocked`` on a deny; and
* the long path -- you call ``control.evaluate_intervention_point(...)``
  yourself and branch on ``verdict.decision`` (allow / deny / escalate /
  transform), which is what you want when wiring ACS into a framework's own
  tool-dispatch hook.

Security invariant: a destructive tool call is *never* executed. The host policy
fails closed (it allows only an explicit "safe" judge verdict), so a destructive
label, an unexpected label, a missing label, or a fail-closed transient all deny.
That invariant is the assertion this example verifies. Because the judge is a live
model, a transient infrastructure error surfaces as a fail-closed
``annotation_failed`` verdict; the host pattern is to retry that (a real policy
deny is never retried), shown in ``govern``.

Scope and caveats: this example judges tool INPUT on PRE_TOOL_CALL. The judge
annotation is not bound on POST_TOOL_CALL, so tool output is evaluated but not
gated here; add an output-side annotation to govern results. The judge also sees
untrusted tool-argument text, so it is subject to prompt injection (an argument
that tries to talk the judge into "safe"); treat an LLM judge as defense in depth
behind deterministic policy, not as the sole control.

How to wire this into a live Foundry agent: register the same callables with
``FunctionTool``/``ToolSet`` and route the SDK's auto function-call hook (the
point where Foundry invokes your Python tool) through ``protect_tool`` so every
tool the agent decides to call is gated by ACS first.
