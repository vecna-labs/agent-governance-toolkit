"""Govern a live Azure AI Foundry hosted agent run with ACS via guard_foundry_agent.

This is the framework-side companion to ``foundry_agents.py``. That file shows the
policy wiring (an LLM judge that classifies each tool argument) and the two manual
integration styles. This file shows the adapter that removes the manual run-loop
boilerplate. ``guard_foundry_agent`` returns a thin proxy over the real
``AgentsClient`` whose governed driver drives the
``requires_action -> submit_tool_outputs`` loop, routes every required function
tool call through ACS ``pre_tool_call`` and ``post_tool_call``, and submits a
policy rejection output instead of executing on a deny.

It reuses ``build_control`` and ``TOOLS`` from ``foundry_agents`` so the very same
fail-closed judge policy now governs a real hosted agent run rather than an
in-process call. The agent is created without auto function calling, so the model
decides which tool to call and ACS gates each call before the host executes it.

Run it with real credentials set (see ``_common.require_azure`` plus the Foundry
project variables below)::

    export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=...          # judge backend, see foundry_agents.py
    export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=...
    export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=...
    export AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=...   # https://<res>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>
    export AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_AGENT_MODEL=...         # hosted agent model deployment name
    pip install "agent-control-specification" azure-ai-agents azure-identity
    # opa must be on PATH (or ACS_OPA_PATH); the Rego policy runs through OPA
    python foundry_agent_guarded.py

Security invariant. A destructive tool call is never executed. The judge policy
fails closed, so a destructive label, an unexpected label, a missing label, or a
fail-closed transient all deny, and the adapter submits a rejection output for the
denied call so the agent learns it was blocked.
